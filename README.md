<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
The project aims to simulate the growth of a biofilm in early stages. An biofilm is an consortium of bacteria embedded in a extracelluar matrix consisting of EPS  (extracellular polymeric substances). Origin of such biofilms is the attachment of initial bacteria to a surface.

As part of the iGEM Competition 2020, the Hannover Team designed a sensor based on biological cell, which is capable of detecting the adhernce of a biofilm to at an early stage. The sensor can be attached to implant surfaces and used as a diagnostical tool.
Therefore, we are interested in the growth behaviour of biofilms in an early stage.
We use computational methods of Molecular Dynamics simulation and a biophysical approach to model the biofilm growth.

### Built With

* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may set up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites 
We recommend installing anaconda on your machine. Anaconda provides many functionalities including an easy way to set up python enviroments. 
Check out the [Anaconda installation instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

### Installation

You will need a few python packages to run the simulation on your local machine. You can eithercreate a conda enviroment from the 
`conda_env.yml` file or download the packages on your own via pip.
We provide step-by-step instructions on how to get our software running using a conda enviroment.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/StudDavid/biofilm_growth_modeling.git
```
2. Navigate in the src folder and run 

```sh
conda env create -f biofilm_model_env.yml
```

3. Start the enviroment by running 
```sh
conda activate biofilm_model_env
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A usage example is provided in form of a jupyter notebook. Make sure to check it out to see the functionalities provided. 
If you are using anaconda, jupyter will already be installed. To start the example jupyter notebook run

```sh
jupyter-notebook
```
Then connect to 
```sh
http://localhost:8888/
```
and navigate to the folder, in which you cloned the repository. Start the notebook by clicking on the `example.ipynb` file.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
